# Integration Core

This module contains shared code used across all areas of the integration engine and is still under development. Current features include:

<ol>
    <li>Domain model</li>
    <li>JPA Repositories</li>
    <li>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)</li>
    <li>Domain model to DTO mappers</li>
</ol>


Unit tests still need to be written.
